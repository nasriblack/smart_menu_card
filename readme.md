# 📋 Smart Menu Card

## 🌟 Description
Smart Menu Card is an innovative project designed to revolutionize the dining experience by creating a personalized menu for users based on their preferences. The user interacts with the system by answering a few simple questions such as dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, budget, and mood. Using this input, the application generates a tailored menu that perfectly matches their needs. This project leverages modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience.

Built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**, Smart Menu Card ensures high performance, scalability, and maintainability. Additionally, it integrates with external APIs like OpenAI to generate intelligent responses, making the menu generation process dynamic and intuitive.
